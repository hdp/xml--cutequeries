=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item B<new()>

New takes a few arguments describing the error.

=over 4

=item B<type>

This is a numeric argument describing the error type.  The only valid choices
so far are B<DATA_ERROR>s and B<QUERY_ERROR>s.  The symbols aren't exported, so
you'd invoke them like this:

    XML::Twigx::CuteQueries::Error->new(
        type => XML::Twigx::CuteQueries::Error::QUERY_ERROR(),

    )->throw;

Arguably sloppy, but this interface isn't I<really> intended for end users.
This can also be set with L</type()> below.

=item B<text>

This is a textual description of the error.

    XML::Twigx::CuteQueries::Error->new(
        type => XML::Twigx::CuteQueries::Error::QUERY_ERROR(),
        text => "that query makes no sense because of the Ten Commandments",

    )->throw;

Arguably sloppy, but this interface isn't I<really> intended for end users.
This can also be set with L</text()> below.

=back

=item B<type()>

An I<accessor> for the L</type> of the error.

    warn "type: " . $@->type;
    my $e = XML::Twigx::CuteQueries::Error->new;
       $e->type( XML::Twigx::CuteQueries::Error::DATA_ERROR() );

=item B<text()>

An I<accessor> for the L</text> of the error.

    warn "type: " . $@->type;
    my $e = XML::Twigx::CuteQueries::Error->new;
       $e->text( "haha, error.  You == fail." );

=item B<query_error()>

Returns true if the error type is a query error.
